        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p> The BICEP Array 1 receiver (BA1) has an absorptive forebaffle attached to reduce signal contamination from the ground. 
            The forebaffle acts as a shield that absorbs stray light to ensure the receiver sees only signal from the sky. 
            Unfortunately, the forebaffle itself contributes its own thermal loading onto the BA1 detectors.
            In this posting, we measure the thermal loading caused by the BA1 forebaffle in various configurations. </p>

        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>The detectors in BA1 are Transition Edge Sensors (TES), which pass along a signal that is later amplified by Superconductive Quantum
            Interference Devices (SQuIDs). </p>
        <p>The TES works as follows. Light from the sky and environment is captured by antennas, which then heats up the microwave termination (Fig 2.1b). 
            A resister sits at the edge of the transition between superconducting and normal, so a slight change in temperature creates a 
            significant change in resistance, causing \(R_{TES}\) to be extremely sensitive to photons absorbed by the antenna. 
            A bias current is passed throgh the entire circuit, so 
            this change in resistance then causes a change in the current \(I_{TES}\) passing through \(R_{TES}\), which 
            ultimately amplified by the inductively coupled SQuID. Because the TES is also thermally coupled to a 
            thermal bath, the temperature eventually returns to the edge of the transition.

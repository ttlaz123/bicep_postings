			<h1> Keck umux Demonstrator Design Review </h1>
			<h3> May 18, 2018 - Cyndia Yu </h3>
		</div>

		<section>
			<h2> Summary </h2>
			<p>
				This posting presents an overview of the Keck umux demonstrator design
				as of May 1, 2018. The RF chain, DC routing, and receiver modifications
				progress will be covered here. Where possible, efforts have been made to
				minimize major changes to the current Keck setup. The focal plane
				module modifications and SMuRF electronics are not included in this review. 
				All designs are documented in the SVN under BICEP_Array/dev/20180508_BK_umux/.
				</p>

		</section>

		<section>
			<h2> RF Chain </h2>

			<p> The RF chain consists of a single pair of coaxial cables that will carry signals
			to and from the SMuRF electronics crate. These will replace the MCE and SSA modules
			in the current Keck design. A schematic of the RF chain is shown in Figure 2.1. We 
			use stainless steel coaxes at warmer stages, CuNi to reduce thermal loading from 
			4K into the FPU, and NbTi from the module box to the HEMT amplifier. A bias tee
			at the input of the HEMT serves as both a DC block and heatsink. Modern HEMTs are
			in theory able to properly heatsink the center pins without the addition of the
			bias tee; however, we include it here for completeness. The RF design is
			modular to allow for insertion and removal of passive components as deemed
			appropriate. A 50K follow-on amplifier has been included in this design. Its 
			performance is pending verification.

		<h2> DC Routing </h2>

		<p> A DC line is needed to provide power to the amplifiers, as well as
		distribute the flux ramp and detector bias lines. We will reuse the
		MDM cables already existing in Keck.
		</p>

		<figure>
		<img src="Keck%20umux%20Design%20Review%2020180518_fichiers/dc_chain.png" width="50%">
			<figcaption> The proposed DC chain reusing existing Tekdata cables. 
			Note that Cristek filters on the 300K stage are not shown here.

			standard reference.
			</figcaption>
		</figure>


		<p>The 4K PCB distributes the flux ramp and detector bias lines to
		the two 37-way cables that connect to each focal plane module. This
		additionally has a breakout to power the HEMT.</p>

		<h4>Question</h4> How do we want to power the 50K follow-on amplifier?
		Current idea is to run a pair of wires back from the 4K stage, rather than
		adding another hole in the 300K or a break in the 50K DC line.


		</section>

		<section>
		<h2> Receiver Modifications </h2>

		<p> A number of modifications have been made to accommodate the new RF chain. We have tried
		to keep these modifications minimal. These are outlined below from the outside of the
		cryostat and proceeding inwards. The FPU module modifications have not been included here.
		</p>


		<h3> 300K stage </h3>

		<p>The MCE feedthroughs have been replaced with 2 hermetic bulkhead connectors
		for the RF lines. One MDM 100-way connector has been kept for the DC line. The
		housekeeping feedthrough is untouched. The vacuum feedthrough design is in 
		progress at Harvard.
		</p>

		<h3> 50K stage </h3>

		<p> The 50K closeout plate has been adjusted slightly. A small piece
		has been removed to accommodate an amplifier mount plate. The smaller piece
		is installed first, and the full plate is installed afterwards. 
		</p>

		<p> As designed, the amplifier screws directly into the smaller plate. We can
		consider putting it on a separate bracket for better heat-sinking. The amplifier
		is 50.5mm long, so including SMA connectors and a DC block I think it unlikely 
		that we can offset it vertically. Instead, it seems better to route a stainless 
		steel coax with the use of a right angle connector off of the amplifier.
		</p>

		<p> This design is in progress at Harvard. </p>
			<!--The 50K plate must be replaced. We have designed it in two parts: a piece for mounting the
			   amplifier and bulkheads and the main closeout plate. -->



		<h3> 4K stage </h3>

		<p> The 4K stage has substantially more room thanks to the removal of the SSA
		boards. The closeout plate removes two MCE MDM's and replaces them with two
		RF ports. A bracket with generic holes mounts the RF passive components chain.
		In order to ease installation, a bulkhead is included so that both the input
		and output lines have a break at the amplifier mounting bracket. 
		</p>

			<h4>Note</h4> In order to provide a straighter path for 50K to 4K stage 
			cable routing, we are considering moving the coaxes on the feedthrough 
			closer to the center of the part. However, we would like to avoid crossing
			the MDM with the coaxes. This potential update has not yet been realized.



		<h3> IC mezzanine </h3>

		<p> One side of the MCE heatsink has been replaced. In order to avoid routing
		wires across the IC mezzanine and around the heatstrap, all RF components have
		been placed on one side. Figure 4.6 provides several views of the before and
		after of the IC mezzanine.

			<figcaption>
			The IC mezzanine has one side of the MCE replaced with an RF heatsink. This
			heatsink houses two pairs of bulkheads (connecting to 4K and UC), the circulator,
			and the directional coupler. We have chosen to keep everything on one side rather
			than routing across the middle of the mezzanine where the heatstrap is.
			</figcaption>

			</figure>


		<p> The RF line comes in from the 4K stage and goes through the directional
		coupler on the way in before being passed up to the UC stage. Coming back, it
		goes through the circulator before being passed back down to the 4K stage. A
		schematic of a possible wiring route with the direction of the signal is shown
		in Figure 4.7. This route includes the bulkhead mount/heatsink that connects to
		right angles. If we eliminate these in favor of semirigid copper, the copper
		coaxes would take the place of the cable + bulkhead + right angle and terminate
		in a female connector. The bulkhead mount would then be slotted to provide some
		heatsinking for the coaxes.  
		</p>

			<figcaption> A rough schematic of a possible wiring scheme for the IC
			mezzanine. Each of these wires is at least 6cm in length, which should
			be enough length to work with. The input signal heading to the UC stage
			is given in blue, while the output signal heading down to 4K is shown
			in green.
		</figcaption></figure>

		<p> The RF heatsink consists of two pairs of RF lines, one coming up from 4K and
		the other going up to the UC stage. The coaxes line up with the hole in the sub-K
		space, where the MCE cables used to run. See Figure 4.8. We will probably have to
		add some tape in order to guard the coaxes, but I expect the space is plenty
		large.

		<h4>Note</h4> The circulator and directional coupler are screwed in from below,
		which means the full IC mezzanine must be undone in order to remove or replace
		them. Do we want to design an adapter plate instead? This could improve heat
		sinking but would be trickier to fit.

<h4>Identifying Faulty Chips</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Connect the screening PCB to the screening tower.</li>
    <li>Record the resistance of the Input, Row Selects, and Feedback lines using a multimeter and the breakout
        box.</li>
    <li>With the PCB still attached, probe the pairs of pins with just a multimeter to record the resistance of
        the Out lines.</li>
    <li>Detach the PCB from the tower, and record the resistance of the Out lines.</li>
    <li>Using the multimeter, probe the connectors directly to determine the resistance of Input, Row Select,
        and Feedback lines. Note that the Row Select numbers are 1 off from the numbers marked on the PCB.</li>
    <li>Identify any resistance reading that is more than 10% off from the other readings of the same type,
        or when a difference in resistance is caused by connecting the PCB to the tower.</li>
</ul>
<p>The purpose of recording two sets of resistances is to see if any abnormal resistance readings are a result
    of
    cross-shorts. When the PCB is connected to the tower, every connector is connected to a common ground. Thus,
    any
    cross-short would allow a current to flow through an additional path to the common ground, causing a change
    in
    resistance. The most common identified errors are cross-shorts, opens, and single point abnormal
    resistances.
    We will explore how to identify the exact chip in each of these cases.</p>

<b>Cross-short:</b>
<ul>
    <li>
        The cross-short means that within a specific chip, electrical lines are shorted where they shouldn't be.
        This leads to a smaller resistance reading for any measurement involving the short.
    </li>
    <li>
        For example, if a chip has the RS 4 shorted to the Feedback line, then while the tower is connected
        to the PCB, this will result in a smaller resistance reading for both the feedback in that channel
        and for the entire row select. When the tower is not connected, the resistances will read normally,
        because the cross-short will not allow current to flow through the disconnected ground.
    </li>
    <li>
        To verify the chip that is causing the lowered resistance readings, while the PCB is disconnected
        from the tower, measure the resistance between the RS 4 connector and the feedback row that
        contains the chip. If this resistance is not open, that indicates a cross-short.
    </li>
    <li> When the cross-short occurs between a row select and a channel reading like FB, OUT, or INPUT, then
        it is easy to find the faulty chip by finding the row and column where a short exists.
    </li>
    <li>When the cross-short occurs between two row readings or two column readings, then identification
        becomes trickier. The most certain method is to debond and bypass a chip, then remeasure the
        resistances. If the resistance readings become normal, then that was the faulty chip. Otherwise,
        rebond and debond a different chip until the problem chip is found. There are other tricks for
        identifying the problem chip more quickly like calculating the position through expected
        resistance readings, but those methods require more intuition and experience and have a
        higher chance of damaging the chip.
    </li>
</ul>
<b>Opens:</b>
<ul>
    <li>Opens are identified by measuring an unexpected open across the disconnected PCB. An open on a row
        select
        could be any one of 8 chips in the row, while an open across a column has only 3 potential suspects.
    </li>
    <li>
        Opens can always be caused by a faulty wirebond. Before performing additional wirebonds to short across
        suspected opens, it may save time to perform pull tests on the wirebonds in the problem row/column.
    </li>
    <li>When there's an open across the Feedback or Out, start shorting across chips starting from row Z. By
        wirebonding
        the two Feedback/Out pads on row Y, the chip on row Z becomes bypassed. Measure the resistance. Repeat
        until
        the multimeter no longer reads open, and the last bypassed chip is the cause of the open. Bonding on the
        PCB pads
        decreases the possibility of damage on the chips themselves.

    </li>
    <li>
        If there's an open across the Input, choose a chip in the column, then perform a long wirebond from one
        end of the
        input to the other. Measure to check if the Input row is still open. Repeat until the open Input chip is
        identified.
    </li>
    <li>If there's an open across a RS, choose a chip in the row, then wirebond the two adjacent RS pads to
        short the RS
        of that chip. Measure the RS to check for the open. Repeat until the open RS chip is identified.
    </li>
</ul>

<b>Singular abnormal readings</b>
<ul>
    <li>
        Very occassionally, a single resistance reading will be significantly higher or lower than expected, but
        without affecting the resistance readings of any other lines.
    </li>
    <li>
        In this case, the procedure is similar to that of identifying faulty chip causing an open: short across
        each chip in the row/column and observe the change in resistance. For row selects, shorting across
        a single chip should decrease the resistance reading by about 1.0kOhm +- 0.1 kOhm. The full list of
        expected resistance per chip will be in the next section.
    </li>
    <li>
        If the change in resistance is much higher or lower than expected, that indicates that the chip contains
        a singular abnormal reading, and needs to be bypassed.
    </li>
</ul>
Once the problem chips are identified, the temporary shorting bonds are removed, and the problem chip is
bypassed.

<h4>Bypassing Chips</h4>

<ul>
    <li>To bypass a squid chip, we remove the wirebonds attached the chip and replace them with shorting bonds
        on the PCB bond pads. The squid chip may be removed to ease the shorting process.
    </li>
    <li>
        The row selects are the easiest to short across. The RS+ bond and the RS- bond are next to each other,
        so to make the shorting bond, simply bond the two adjacent RS pads on the PCB.
    </li>
    <li>
        The input shorting bond requires bonding across the entire chip. The Out and Feedback lines
        have similar shorting bonds, except two bonds are required because the signal and ground
        both come from the left side.
    </li>
    <li>
        When the chip to bypass is in column Z, it provides an easier shorting bond. Here, it is only necessary
        to bond the adjacent Out and Feedback pads to the left of the Z chip. If both Y and Z need to be
        bypassed,
        then it is only necessary to bond the adjacent pads to the left of the Y chip, as shown in the figure
        below.
        If all three chips are to be bypassed, then none of the shorting bonds are required besides the
        RS shorting bonds, as that column will not be screened during cold screening anyway.
    </li>
</ul>
The Figure below has diagrams for the different types of shorting bonds. Every type of shorting bond bypasses
a single chip except for the shorting bond on the Feedback and Out diagram. When that type of shorting bond is
placed, every chip to the right is bypassed. In the diagram, both chip Y and Z are bypassed with just two
wirebonds. The diagram shows Chip X, the left side of Chip Y, and the right side of Chip Z for column 0 only.

After the bypassing is complete, an additional resistance check should be performed to verify there are no more
abnormalities. Due to the bypassing, some of the resistance readings will be lower. The table below specifies
the approximate expected resistance for each non-bypassed chip. Note that the specific numbers will vary by chip
wafer, with a deviation up to 10-20%.

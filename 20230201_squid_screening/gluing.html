    <h1>Procedure</h1>
    <h4>Gluing: 30 - 60 min per board</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Clean the PCB bond pads with the white eraser, pink eraser, and isopropyl alcohol in the respective
            order. The bond pads should be shiny by the end of the cleaning</li>
        <li>Set up 3 aluminum trays, 1 for isopropyl alcohol (IPA), and 2 for acetone. Squirt the liquids into their
            respective tins up to a depth of approximately 5 mm, enough to submerge the Squid chips.</li>
        <li>Using a vacuum try handling system, carefully remove a chip from its gel pack with tweezers.</li>
        <li>While holding the chip with tweezers, gently shake the chip in the acetone tray for 10 seconds or until
            the photoresist has been completely removed.
            Repeat the chip shaking in the other acetone tray, then in the IPA tray. If the chip already has its
            photoresist removed, the first aceton tray is optional.</li>
        <li>Holding the chip on the Kimwipe, blow dry nitrogen from a Compressed Nitrogen Gun until chip is dry.
        </li>
        <li>Using a small wooden rod, lightly dab the bottle of rubber cement to cover the tip of the rod. </li>
        <li>Apply the glue from the wooden rod onto a Squid chip slot on the PCB, then place the Squid chip on top
            of the glue, ensuring correct orientation.
            Use two wooden rods to press the Squids onto the board, making sure to only touch the corners of the
            chip. </li>
        <li>Repeat the process until the board is full of Squid chips. Use a microscope to verify the IDs of the
            chips,
            and record them in a table while double checking for the correct orientation.</li>
    </ul>

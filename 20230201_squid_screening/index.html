        <h3>Squid Chip Preparation and Mounting</h3>
        At this stage, the goal is the mount the desired number of Squid chips onto the screening board. The screening PCB contains 24 slots for Squid chips, 
        but not all 24 slots need to be used. The chips need to be glued, wirebonded, and have their positions recorded. 
        <h4>General notes</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Always grab the chips with tweezers by the edges of the chip; try to avoid touching the flat top of the chip whenever possible</li>
            <li>Wear electrostatic discharge (ESD) protection whenever possible</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Gluing: 30 - 60 min per board</h4>
        Below is a summary of the procedure for gluing chips onto a PCB. For a more detailed Standard Operating Procedure, see here: 
        <a href="gluing.html">Gluing Procedure</a>

        <ul>
            <li>Clean the PCB bond pads with the white eraser, pink eraser, and isopropyl alcohol in the respective order. The bond pads should be shiny by the end of the cleaning</li>
            <li>Set up 3 aluminum trays, 1 for isopropyl alcohol (IPA), and 2 for acetone. Squirt the liquids into their respective tins up to a depth of approximately 5 mm, enough to submerge the Squid chips.</li>
            <li>Using a vacuum try handling system, carefully remove a chip from its gel pack with tweezers.</li> 
            <li>While holding the chip with tweezers, gently shake the chip in the acetone tray for 10 seconds or until the photoresist has been completely removed. 
                Repeat the chip shaking in the other acetone tray, then in the IPA tray. If the chip already has its photoresist removed, the first aceton tray is optional.</li>
            <li>Holding the chip on the Kimwipe, blow dry nitrogen from a Compressed Nitrogen Gun until chip is dry.</li>
            <li>Using a small wooden rod, lightly dab the bottle of rubber cement to cover the tip of the rod. </li>
            <li>Apply the glue from the wooden rod onto a Squid chip slot on the PCB, then place the Squid chip on top of the glue, ensuring correct orientation. 
                Use two wooden rods to press the Squids onto the board, making sure to only touch the corners of the chip. </li>
            <li>Repeat the process until the board is full of Squid chips. Use a microscope to verify the IDs of the chips, 
                and record them in a table while double checking for the correct orientation.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Wirebonding (2 - 4 hr per board)</h4>
        Below is a summary of how to wirebond each group of pads. For a more detailed explanation, see here: 
        <a href="wirebond.html">Wirebonding Procedure</a>
        <ul>
            <li>Mount the PCB onto the wirebonding block</li>
            <li>Wirebond the row selects, making sure to start at the copper PCB pads and end on the NbTi pads of the Squids. 
                There are a total of 11 row selects per chip, with an input and output, for a total of 22 wirebonds per chip. 
                A full board has a max of 24 chips, for a maximum of 528 bonds.
            </li>
            <li>Wirebond the inputs in a stitch pattern on the Squid chip, ensuring the input coils are all connected in series. 
                Ensure that the bonds are in the middle of the pad so that the bond surface does not touch two different pads. 
                Keeping the bonds short and triangular shaped will also decrease the probability of cross-shorts.
                Then, wirebond the first and last input on the chip to the PCB. 
                There are a total of 11 inputs, requiring 10 wirebonds to connect them in series. 
                Adding the two wirebonds for connecting the inputs to the PCB, this is a total of 12 wirebonds per chip. 
                This is a total of 288 max bonds per board.
            </li>
            <li>Wirebond the feedback and output pads. These bonds on the sides of the chips are mostly straightforward except for the bonds
                on the outside of row X. These bonds are in a pentagonal shape with crossing wires, increasing the chance of contact shorts. 
                Great care must be taken to ensure ideal bond lengths. There are a total of 8 bonds per chip, for a maximum of 192 bonds per board.
            </li>
            <li>
                Once all the wirebonds are complete, either store the board in a nitrogen cabinet or move directly to room temperature screening. 
                A single board has a maximum of 1008 bonds, from 42 bonds per chip.
            </li>
        </ul>

                        return filename
                    });

        <h3>Room Temperature Screening</h3>
        This step is crucial for increasing the yield of the overall screening process. Without checking for opens and cross-shorts at room temperature,
        these issues can cause an entire row or column of chips to fail cold screening. Here, we identify the chips that read abnormal resistances,
        then wirebond over the chip to bypass the chip entirely.

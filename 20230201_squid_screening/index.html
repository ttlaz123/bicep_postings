        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            Superconducting Quantum Interference Devices, or SQuIDs, have been used in detector modules for many years.
            As the detector density has increased with newer receivers, so has the required number of SQuID chips.
            The newest BICEP receivers, BA2 and BA4, each have 12 detector modules requiring 64 squid chips each, for a
            total of 768 chips.
        </p>
        <p>
            Unfortunately, squid chips are frequently faulty, and a single failed chip will often affect the performance
            of
            nearby chips in a module. Thus, it is necessary to pre-screen the squid chips before integrating them into
            the detector modules. This screening was historically performed by Prof. Kent Irwin's lab before the task
            was transfered to Prof. Chao-Lin Kuo's lab in the summer of 2022.
        </p>
        <p>
            Below, we summarize the procedure and statistics of the squid screening since it was taken up by the Kuo
            lab.
        </p>
        <h3>Common Terminology</h3>
        For a more comprehensive glossary, see <a href="glossary.html">here</a>. 
        <ul>
            <li><b>SQuID</b>: Superconducting Quantum Interference Device measures small magnetic fields. 
                Wikipedia article: <a href="articles/squid_wiki.pdf">SQuID</a></li>
            <li><b>Squid chip</b>: The Mux 15b SQuID chip produced by NIST acts as an amplifier for the detector modules. 
                Measuring 3.0 mm by 6.6 mm, these small chips require an initial round of screening before they can be installed. 
                In the chip, there are RS squids, which receive flux from the row selects, and SQ1 squids, which receive 
                flux from Input and Feedback. </li>
            <li><b>Screening PCB</b>: The DrEleven PCB holds up to 24 chips with 3 columns marked X, Y, Z and 8 rows from 0 through 7.
                The Squid chip must first be wirebonded to the screening PCB before any screening can take place. </li>
            <li><b>Dip Probe</b>: Also called the <b>Screening Tower</b>, it houses all the electronics for both 
                sending the Squid chip inputs and receiving outputs from the chips. The Screening PCB must first be 
                connected to the dip probe before in order to be dipped into liquid helium for cryogenic screening.
            </li>
            <li><b>Input (IN)</b>: The input coils receive signal from the detectors during operation and produce flux through the SQ1 squids. 
                However, during the screening process,
                they are simply checked for connectivity and cross-shorts. The 22 input pads (which connects to the 11 input coils),
                are on the bottom side of the squid chip. 
            </li>
            <li><b>Row Select (RS)</b>: The row selects pass flux through ths RS squids, which turn on and off, or "select", a specific input 
                to be read out. The 22 row select pads are
                on the top side of the squid chip.
            </li>
            <li><b>Output (OUT1/2, SQ1OUT)</b>: The output line is connected to the SQ1BIAS line. Current is passed in, and the output of the 
                current is read as the response of the squid chip. During normal operation, the output is set to a particular 
                value, but during screening, the output sweeps through multiple current values to check its response.
                The pads are on the top half of the sides of the chip. 
            </li>
            <li><b>Feedback (FB1/2, SQ1FB)</b>: The feedback line passes in a current that produces flux through the squids. This flux 
                affects to response of the SQ1 squid. During normal operation, the FB follows the 
                input to ensure maximum senstivity, but during Squid Screening, the FB sweeps through 
                different currents to visualize the characteristic squid sine wave.

        <h2>Procedure</h2>

        <h3>Squid Chip Preparation and Mounting: 2.5 - 5 hours per board</h3>
        At this stage, the goal is the mount the desired number of Squid chips onto the screening board. The screening
        PCB contains 24 slots for Squid chips,
        but not all 24 slots need to be used. The chips need to be glued, wirebonded, and have their positions recorded.
        <h4>General notes</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Always grab the chips with tweezers by the edges of the chip; try to avoid touching the flat top of the
                chip whenever possible</li>
            <li>Wear electrostatic discharge (ESD) protection whenever possible: wristbands, ESD mats</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Gluing: 30 - 60 min per board</h4>
        For a more detailed procedure, see here:
        <a href="gluing.html">Gluing Procedure</a>.
        <p>First clean the screening PCB, clean the chips, then using rubber cement, glue the squid chips onto the PCB.
            Cleaning takes 5-10 minutes, while each chip takes 1-2 minutes to glue, for a total of 30-60 minutes per
            PCB.
        </p>
        <h4>Wirebonding: 2 - 4 hr per board</h4>
        Below is a summary of wirebonding. For a more detailed procedure, see here:
        <a href="wirebond.html">Wirebonding Procedure</a>
        <p>
            For each row of 8 chips, the wirebonding connects all the row selects in series.
            For each column of 3 chips,
            the wirebonding connects the Feedbacks, Inputs, and Outputs in series. Each chip requires 42 wirebonds for
            its
            52 pads. Each chip takes between 5-30 minutes to wirebond, depending on wirebonder setting, wire
            cooperation,
            and general experience.
            This accounts for a total of 2-12 hours per board, but an experienced wirebonder can usually finish a board
            within 4 hours.

                        return filename
                    });

                    {
                        'dia': 'compare',
                    }
                );

            </script>

        <h3>Room Temperature Screening: 20 - 120 min per board</h3>
        <p>
            This step is crucial for increasing the yield of the overall screening process. Without checking for opens
            and
            cross-shorts at room temperature,
            these issues can cause an entire row or column of chips to fail cold screening. Here, we identify the chips
            that
            read abnormal resistances,
            then wirebond over the chip to bypass the chip entirely.
        </p>
        <p>
            Below is a summary of the procedure for identifying faulty chips. For a detailed account, see here: <a
                href="roomtemp.html">Room Temperature Screening Procedure</a>

        </p>
        <p>
            We use a multimeter to directly measure the
            resistance of the squid chips at room temperature.
            Because the squids are connected in series,
            the expected readout of the Row Select, Input, Feedback, and Output are some multiple of the
            resistances of each individual chip. The resistance measurement is also different depending on
            whether or not the screening tower is connected because of a series resistance.
        </p>
        <p>
            The table below shows the expected readings, and the
            pager has an example of recorded resistances. If the actual readings do not match the
            expected, then some chips will fail the room temperature screening, which is
            performed in the <a href="roomtemp.html">Room Temperature Screening Procedure</a>.

                    In the comparison of the circuit diagram to the realistic schematic, the red and green pads/lines
                    correspond to each other. Columns 4 and 5 are empty (e), so there is nothing recorded there, and
                    the row selects are about 2.2 kOhms lower than if the PCB were fully populated.
                    Row select 17 was initially open, but now reads the expected resistance after correction. Also
                    notice
                    that when the PCB is disconnected from the screening tower, the FB reading is about 5kOhms lower.
                    This is because there is a 5 kOhms series resistance from the PCB to the tower.

                    In the probing diagrams, the blue represents traces above the PCB, while the red represents
                    traces below the PCB. Row select probing measures the resistance of 8 chips in series, while
                    the other probing measures the resistance of 3 chips in series.

        <h3>Cryogenic Testing: 3 - 4 hours per board</h3>
        For a detailed procedure, see:
        <a href="cryotest.html">Cryogenic Screening Procedure</a>
        <p>
            We plunge the screening tower with a populated screening PCB into helium to test the performance
            of the squid chips at 4K, which is within its superconducting range. After connecting the
            tower to the screening electronics and running the screening software, we identify the
            \(I_{C,col}\) for each column of chips and the \(I_{C,min}\), \(I_{C,max}\), and modulation of each row
            select. An example of expected readings is shown below.

                <p>
                    When measuring Ic col, the curve should start out flat and slowly curve up. The Ic col
                    is the influction point: where the modulation just starts to increase. The Ic min is
                    measured similarly to the Ic col, except a row select is turned on, so the modulation
                    begins much earlier. The Ic max is measured as the maximum modulation for a specific
                    row select. The Ic col should be significantly higher than the Ic max.

        <h3>Packaging and Delivery</h3>
        Once the screening results are obtained, each chip is sorted into passed, failed (includes both chips that
        were bypassed during room temperature screening and failed cold screening), or need to be rescreened.
        <h4>Dismounting Chips</h4>
        A tweezer is used to pull off the wirebonds. Two wooden sticks are used to twist the squid chips from the
        side, which twists off the rubber cement used to glue the chip. The chip is then placed into a gel pack
        labeled passed, failed, or rescreen. Repeat until all the chips are sorted.
        <h4>Final Verfication and Delivery</h4>
        Each chip in the passed gelpack is observed under a microscope to verify its ID, which is used to
        cross-reference the screening data. Once verification is complete, the gel pack is packaged and shipped.
        For a detailed account on how to package a gel pack of squid chips, see here: <a href="package.html">Squid
            Packaging</a>.

        The cold Screening data is compiled into a zip file with the code on Kent Irwin's computer. It provides
        the Ic min, max and modulation for each of the passed chips, as well as information about Ic,col.

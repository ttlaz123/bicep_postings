        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            Superconducting Quantum Interference Devices, or SQuIDs, have been used in detector modules for many years.
            As the detector density has increased with newer receivers, so has the required number of SQuID chips.
            The newest BICEP receivers, BA2 and BA4, each have 12 detector modules requiring 64 squid chips each, for a
            total of 768 chips.
        </p>
        <p>
            Unfortunately, squid chips are frequently faulty, and a single failed chip will often affect the performance
            of
            nearby chips in a module. Thus, it is necessary to pre-screen the squid chips before integrating them into
            the detector modules. This screening was historically performed by Prof. Kent Irwin's lab before the task
            was transfered to Prof. Chao-Lin Kuo's lab in the summer of 2022.
        </p>
        <p>
            Below, we summarize the procedure and statistics of the squid screening since it was taken up by the Kuo
            lab.
        </p>
        <h3>The SQuID Chip, Screening PCB, and Screening Tower</h3>
        <p>
            The MUX 15b SQuID Chip is quite small and fragile, measuring 6.6 mm by 3.0 mm by 0.18 mm. While handling,
            great care
            must be taken
            to only handle the sides of the chip, as touching the top can damage the sensitive electronics. The squids
            are
            delivered
            by NIST in gel packs, which serve as their ideal storage system due to the electrical insulation and
            physical
            stability.
        </p>
        <p>
            The chip serves as an amplifier at its superconducting temperatures below 10K, but it is typically
            tested and used at temperatures below 4K. As a time domain multiplexor, the squid reads in 11 inputs (IN)
            that are
            all output on a single output line (OUT). The row selects (RS) are applied to select a single input at a
            time
            for a specific amount of time. By correlating the signal to the corresponding row select, it is possible to
            read
            out 11 different inputs with a single squid chip.
        </p>
        <p>
            The feedback line (FB) serves to bias the input to maximize the sensitivity, but during screening, the FB
            acts as the varying input to verify the ideal bias current that should run through OUT.
        </p>

            The Dr Eleven screening PCB has 24 slots for squid chips and 10 connectors, each of which has 8
            signal/ground pairs.
            The row selects make up the majority of the connectors, with 5 connectors responsible for the 33 row
            selects. With 3 rows labeled X, Y, and Z, each row select activates the response of up to 8 squid chips.
        </p>
        <p>
            The INPUT, FB1, and MUXOUT are connected to the sides of the chip slot area, while
            SAOUT and SAFB are connected to the pin area where the Squid Series Array box is attached during screening.
            These connectors all have 8 signal/ground pairs for the 8 channels labeled 0 through 7.

            The screening tower is a device provided by NIST for the express purpose of interfacing with the
            screening PCB. The top of the tower houses the electronics and the connector sockets for
            interfacing with external electronics like oscilliscopes and current supplies. The 5 rows of HDMI
            cables connect to the Row Selects. For the bottom row, only one connection is used. The
            SMB connectors come in groups of 8 for the 8 channels on the PCB. All the names
            are the same except SQ2BIAS connects to MUXOUT. The connectors
            on the bottom of the tower connect to the Samtech connectors on the screening PCB.

        <h2>Procedure</h2>

        <h3>Squid Chip Preparation and Mounting: 2.5 - 5 hours per board</h3>
        At this stage, the goal is the mount the desired number of Squid chips onto the screening board. The screening
        PCB contains 24 slots for Squid chips,
        but not all 24 slots need to be used. The chips need to be glued, wirebonded, and have their positions recorded.
        <h4>General notes</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Always grab the chips with tweezers by the edges of the chip; try to avoid touching the flat top of the
                chip whenever possible</li>
            <li>Wear electrostatic discharge (ESD) protection whenever possible</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Gluing: 30 - 60 min per board</h4>
        Below is a summary of the procedure for gluing chips onto a PCB. For a more detailed Standard Operating
        Procedure, see here:
        <a href="gluing.html">Gluing Procedure</a>

        <ul>
            <li>Clean the PCB bond pads with the white eraser, pink eraser, and isopropyl alcohol in the respective
                order. The bond pads should be shiny by the end of the cleaning</li>
            <li>Set up 3 aluminum trays, 1 for isopropyl alcohol (IPA), and 2 for acetone. Squirt the liquids into their
                respective tins up to a depth of approximately 5 mm, enough to submerge the Squid chips.</li>
            <li>Using a vacuum try handling system, carefully remove a chip from its gel pack with tweezers.</li>
            <li>While holding the chip with tweezers, gently shake the chip in the acetone tray for 10 seconds or until
                the photoresist has been completely removed.
                Repeat the chip shaking in the other acetone tray, then in the IPA tray. If the chip already has its
                photoresist removed, the first aceton tray is optional.</li>
            <li>Holding the chip on the Kimwipe, blow dry nitrogen from a Compressed Nitrogen Gun until chip is dry.
            </li>
            <li>Using a small wooden rod, lightly dab the bottle of rubber cement to cover the tip of the rod. </li>
            <li>Apply the glue from the wooden rod onto a Squid chip slot on the PCB, then place the Squid chip on top
                of the glue, ensuring correct orientation.
                Use two wooden rods to press the Squids onto the board, making sure to only touch the corners of the
                chip. </li>
            <li>Repeat the process until the board is full of Squid chips. Use a microscope to verify the IDs of the
                chips,
                and record them in a table while double checking for the correct orientation.</li>
        </ul>

        </figure>
        <h4>Wirebonding: 2 - 4 hr per board</h4>
        Below is a summary of how to wirebond each group of pads. For a more detailed explanation, see here:
        <a href="wirebond.html">Wirebonding Procedure</a>
        <ul>
            <li>Mount the PCB onto the wirebonding block</li>
            <li>Wirebond the row selects, making sure to start at the copper PCB pads and end on the NbTi pads of the
                Squids.
                There are a total of 11 row selects per chip, with an input and output, for a total of 22 wirebonds per
                chip.
                A full board has a max of 24 chips, for a maximum of 528 bonds.
            </li>
            <li>Wirebond the inputs in a stitch pattern on the Squid chip, ensuring the input coils are all connected in
                series.
                Ensure that the bonds are in the middle of the pad so that the bond surface does not touch two different
                pads.
                Keeping the bonds short and triangular shaped will also decrease the probability of cross-shorts.
                Then, wirebond the first and last input on the chip to the PCB.
                There are a total of 11 inputs, requiring 10 wirebonds to connect them in series.
                Adding the two wirebonds for connecting the inputs to the PCB, this is a total of 12 wirebonds per chip.
                This is a total of 288 max bonds per board.
            </li>
            <li>Wirebond the feedback and output pads. These bonds on the sides of the chips are mostly straightforward
                except for the bonds
                on the outside of row X. These bonds are in a pentagonal shape with crossing wires, increasing the
                chance of contact shorts.
                Great care must be taken to ensure ideal bond lengths. There are a total of 8 bonds per chip, for a
                maximum of 192 bonds per board.
            </li>
            <li>
                Once all the wirebonds are complete, either store the board in a nitrogen cabinet or move directly to
                room temperature screening.
                A single board has a maximum of 1008 bonds, from 42 bonds per chip.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Room Temperature Screening: 20 - 120 min per board</h3>
        This step is crucial for increasing the yield of the overall screening process. Without checking for opens and
        cross-shorts at room temperature,
        these issues can cause an entire row or column of chips to fail cold screening. Here, we identify the chips that
        read abnormal resistances,
        then wirebond over the chip to bypass the chip entirely.
        <h4>Identifying Faulty Chips</h4>
        Below is a summary of the procedure for identifying faulty chips. For a detailed account, see here: <a
            href="roomtemp.html">Room Temperature Screening Procedure</a>
        <ul>
            <li>Connect the screening PCB to the screening tower.</li>
            <li>Record the resistance of the Input, Row Selects, and Feedback lines using a multimeter and the breakout
                box.</li>
            <li>With the PCB still attached, probe the pairs of pins with just a multimeter to record the resistance of
                the Out lines.</li>
            <li>Detach the PCB from the tower, and record the resistance of the Out lines.</li>
            <li>Using the multimeter, probe the connectors directly to determine the resistance of Input, Row Select,
                and Feedback lines. Note that the Row Select numbers are 1 off from the numbers marked on the PCB.</li>
            <li>Identify any resistance reading that is more than 10% off from the other readings of the same type,
                or when a difference in resistance is caused by connecting the PCB to the tower.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The purpose of recording two sets of resistances is to see if any abnormal resistance readings are a result
            of
            cross-shorts. When the PCB is connected to the tower, every connector is connected to a common ground. Thus,
            any
            cross-short would allow a current to flow through an additional path to the common ground, causing a change
            in
            resistance. The most common identified errors are cross-shorts, opens, and single point abnormal
            resistances.
            We will explore how to identify the exact chip in each of these cases.</p>

        <b>Cross-short:</b>
        <ul>
            <li>
                The cross-short means that within a specific chip, electrical lines are shorted where they shouldn't be.
                This leads to a smaller resistance reading for any measurement involving the short.
            </li>
            <li>
                For example, if a chip has the RS 4 shorted to the Feedback line, then while the tower is connected
                to the PCB, this will result in a smaller resistance reading for both the feedback in that channel
                and for the entire row select. When the tower is not connected, the resistances will read normally,
                because the cross-short will not allow current to flow through the disconnected ground.
            </li>
            <li>
                To verify the chip that is causing the lowered resistance readings, while the PCB is disconnected
                from the tower, measure the resistance between the RS 4 connector and the feedback row that
                contains the chip. If this resistance is not open, that indicates a cross-short.
            </li>
            <li> When the cross-short occurs between a row select and a channel reading like FB, OUT, or INPUT, then
                it is easy to find the faulty chip by finding the row and column where a short exists.
            </li>
            <li>When the cross-short occurs between two row readings or two column readings, then identification
                becomes trickier. The most certain method is to debond and bypass a chip, then remeasure the
                resistances. If the resistance readings become normal, then that was the faulty chip. Otherwise,
                rebond and debond a different chip until the problem chip is found. There are other tricks for
                identifying the problem chip more quickly like calculating the position through expected
                resistance readings, but those methods require more intuition and experience and have a
                higher chance of damaging the chip.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <b>Opens:</b>
        <ul>
            <li>Opens are identified by measuring an unexpected open across the disconnected PCB. An open on a row
                select
                could be any one of 8 chips in the row, while an open across a column has only 3 potential suspects.
            </li>
            <li>
                Opens can always be caused by a faulty wirebond. Before performing additional wirebonds to short across
                suspected opens, it may save time to perform pull tests on the wirebonds in the problem row/column.
            </li>
            <li>When there's an open across the Feedback or Out, start shorting across chips starting from row Z. By
                wirebonding
                the two Feedback/Out pads on row Y, the chip on row Z becomes bypassed. Measure the resistance. Repeat
                until
                the multimeter no longer reads open, and the last bypassed chip is the cause of the open. Bonding on the
                PCB pads
                decreases the possibility of damage on the chips themselves.

            </li>
            <li>
                If there's an open across the Input, choose a chip in the column, then perform a long wirebond from one
                end of the
                input to the other. Measure to check if the Input row is still open. Repeat until the open Input chip is
                identified.
            </li>
            <li>If there's an open across a RS, choose a chip in the row, then wirebond the two adjacent RS pads to
                short the RS
                of that chip. Measure the RS to check for the open. Repeat until the open RS chip is identified.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <b>Singular abnormal readings</b>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Very occassionally, a single resistance reading will be significantly higher or lower than expected, but
                without affecting the resistance readings of any other lines.
            </li>
            <li>
                In this case, the procedure is similar to that of identifying faulty chip causing an open: short across
                each chip in the row/column and observe the change in resistance. For row selects, shorting across
                a single chip should decrease the resistance reading by about 1.0kOhm +- 0.1 kOhm. The full list of
                expected resistance per chip will be in the next section.
            </li>
            <li>
                If the change in resistance is much higher or lower than expected, that indicates that the chip contains
                a singular abnormal reading, and needs to be bypassed.
            </li>
        </ul>
        Once the problem chips are identified, the temporary shorting bonds are removed, and the problem chip is
        bypassed.

        <h4>Bypassing Chips</h4>

        <ul>
            <li>To bypass a squid chip, we remove the wirebonds attached the chip and replace them with shorting bonds
                on the PCB bond pads. The squid chip may be removed to ease the shorting process.
            </li>
            <li>
                The row selects are the easiest to short across. The RS+ bond and the RS- bond are next to each other,
                so to make the shorting bond, simply bond the two adjacent RS pads on the PCB.
            </li>
            <li>
                The input shorting bond requires bonding across the entire chip. The Out and Feedback lines
                have similar shorting bonds, except two bonds are required because the signal and ground
                both come from the left side.
            </li>
            <li>
                When the chip to bypass is in column Z, it provides an easier shorting bond. Here, it is only necessary
                to bond the adjacent Out and Feedback pads to the left of the Z chip. If both Y and Z need to be
                bypassed,
                then it is only necessary to bond the adjacent pads to the left of the Y chip, as shown in the figure
                below.
                If all three chips are to be bypassed, then none of the shorting bonds are required besides the
                RS shorting bonds, as that column will not be screened during cold screening anyway.
            </li>
        </ul>
        The Figure below has diagrams for the different types of shorting bonds. Every type of shorting bond bypasses
        a single chip except for the shorting bond on the Feedback and Out diagram. When that type of shorting bond is
        placed, every chip to the right is bypassed. In the diagram, both chip Y and Z are bypassed with just two
        wirebonds. The diagram shows Chip X, the left side of Chip Y, and the right side of Chip Z for column 0 only.

        After the bypassing is complete, an additional resistance check should be performed to verify there are no more
        abnormalities. Due to the bypassing, some of the resistance readings will be lower. The table below specifies
        the approximate expected resistance for each non-bypassed chip. Note that the specific numbers will vary by chip
        wafer, with a deviation up to 10-20%.

        <h3>Cryogenic Testing: 3 - 4 hours per board</h3>
        After a screening board has been prepared with chips free of abnormal resistance readings, it is now ready for
        cryogenic screening. The purpose of this stage
        is to ensure each chip can serve its purpose in the detector module as a proper superconducting amplifier. Due
        to the fragile nature of the chips, they may not function
        perfectly despite normal room temperature resistances.

        <h4>Managing Helium: 2-3 hours per dewar</h4>
        To ensure the squid chips are superconducting, they must be dipped into liquid helium, which has a boiling point
        of 4K. Because helium has such a low boiling point, it is necessary to keep it in a well insulated dewawr;
        however,
        the opening must be large enough to fit the screening PCB and the screening tower. Helium in their storage
        dewars
        must be transfered into the specially designed Blue Dewar for screening to procede. For a detailed account on
        how
        to transfer helium, see here: <a href="transfer.html">Helium Transfer</a>. A single 100L dewar of helium
        can screen between 5 - 15 boards depending on how quickly the screening is performed.

        <h4>Connecting to the Software: 30 min per board</h4>
        Once the blue helium dewar is sufficiently filled, the cryogenic screening can proceed. Below is a
        summary for dipping and connecting the screening PCB to the screening software. A detailed procedure
        is here:
        <a href="software.html"> Connecting to Software </a>.
        <ul>
            <li>Attach the Squid Series Array box to the Screening PCB, screw the PCB to the bottom of the
                screening tower, secure the Samtech connectors, and put on the magnetic shield cylinder.
            </li>
            <li>
                With the venting valve open, remove the cap on the blue helium dewar and stick the magnetic shield end
                of the tower into the dewar.
                Be sure to tightly screw the flange onto the blue dewar.
            </li>
            <lI>
                Slowly lower the tower into the blue dewar by alternating the loosening of the white plastic collar.
                Be sure to go slowly enough for the helium to evaporate at a slow rate. Tighten both colors and close
                the venting valve once the tower has reached the bottom.
            </lI>
            <li>
                Connect up the electronics. The relevant connections of the screening tower are nine HDMI sockets,
                32 SMB sockets, a fiber optic socket, and 3 power plugs. Turn on the electronics to their proper
                setting.
                A full list of the electronics and their settings are included in the detailed procedure.
            </li>
            <li>
                Open the automated squid screening software, fill in the date of the screening, and enter the
                name of the PCB.

        <h4>Running the cold screening software: 2-3 hours per board</h4>
        <p>
            The automated screening software checks for 4 quantities: critical current of the column \(I_{C,col}\),
            modulation, current with maximum modulation \(I_{C,max}\), and current with minimum modulation
            \(I_{C,min}\).
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Modulation is specific to each Row select, and it indicates how much an input signal on that row can be
                amplified. The larger the modulation, the easier it is to see a small signal.
            </li>
            <li>For each row select,
                there is a particular device current, \(I_{C,max}\), at which the modulation is at its largest.
            </li>
            <li>
                \(I_{C,col}\) is screened across an entire column of 3 chips, and it indicates the maximum device
                current
                that
                can be applied before current starts flowing through the Input squids, at which point the row is turned
                on.
                Time domain multiplexing requires specific rows to turn on only when current is applied to the specific
                row
                select, thus it is desirable for
                \(I_{C,col}\) to be significantly higher than any \(I_{C,max}\) in the chips on the column. If
                \(I_{C,col}\)
                were lower than the \(I_{C,max}\) in any row, then it is no longer possible to achieve maximum
                modulation
                for the squid chip without certainty which row the signal is arriving from.
            </li>
            <li>
                \(I_{C,min}\) specifies the minimum current at which a specific row sees some modulation. To ensure that
                a particular row only turns on when chosen by the Row Select, it is desireable for \(I_{C,min}\) to
                be significantly above 0, but a small fraction of \(I_{C,max}\) (typically around a fifth to a tenth)
                so there is room to adjust the bias current.
            </li>
        </ul>
        Below is a summary of the cold screening. For a detailed procedure, see here: <a href="software.html"> Running
            the Software </a>
        <ul>
            <li>Ensure the electronics are properly connected, choose a column/channel to screen, and click "Start
                Screening". </li>

            <li>The program will prompt to make sure the SMB connectors are connected to the correct channels: the SAFB
                connector should be connected to the same column number as the channel number being screened,
                but MUXOUT, SAOUT, and FB1 are all connected backward. </li>
            <li>The program will first scan for the modulation of the Squid Series Array. On the Oscilloscope,
                a sine wave should be visible with a modulation that varies over time. Here, the SAFB is providing
                an 8 KHz ramp function as an input current, and the Squid Series Array's response are the
                expected sine waves. During the scan, the bias current varies, which changes the modulation
                response of the sine waves. The purpose of the scan is the determine the series resistance of the
                SSA, which is used in later calculations.
            </li>
            <li>
                The program will now determine the \(I_{C,col}\) of the channel. With all the row selects turned off,
                and the feedback kept at the 8 KHz ramp function, the bias current is slowly increased until
                some modulation is observed. The device current at which the modulation just begins is calculated
                to be \(I_{C,col}\). Recalculate the value if it does not match the observed value on the oscilliscope
            </li>
            <li>
                Next, the program will individually scan each row select. The same varying bias current and feedback
                are applied as for determining \(I_{C,col}\), but an individual row select will be turned on.
                The program will calculate the device current at which modulation just appears, \(I_{C,min}\),
                and the device current
                at which the modulation is at its maximum, \(I_{C,max}\). These values will be recorded in a
                plot shown by the software. The modulation will also be recorded on a separate graph.
                After all the row selects are screened, the program will stop.
                If there are bypassed chips in the row, it saves time to manually skip over the row selects.
            </li>
            <li>Repeat the above until all channels are screened.</li>
            <li> When finished, disconnect the electronics and open the vent valve.
                Remove the tower from the helium dewar slowly, using the white plastic collar to prevent
                the tower from slipping. Unscrew the flange and replace it with the dewar cap.
                Leave the tower on a table to warm up for 20-30 min before running the next board.
                It is very important for all the ice to melt for the next connection to be firm. If
                any water or ice is still on the connectors, it will disrupt the connection of the next board
                as it is lowered into helium, preventing some row selects from being screened.

        <h4>Possible failure modes</h4>
        As the cold screening takes place, it is important to record whether each chip has passed or failed.
        A chip that passes screening requires the following criteria:
        <ul>
            <li>Each of its 11 row selects have approximately the same \(I_{C,max}\), \(I_{C,min}\), and modulation.
                Typical values are between 8-10 microamps for \(I_{C,max}\), 1-2 microamps for \(I_{C,min}\), and
                20-30 V for modulation. These values should be within approximately 10% of each other; otherwise,
                it suggests the squid's waveform is not a perfect sine wave.
            </li>
            <li>
                The \(I_{C,col}\) of the channel which contains the chip is above every \(I_{C,max}\). To determine
                whether the \(I_{C,col}\) is high enough, it is necessary to observe the plot produced during
                screening. If the plot appears to modulate slowly, it likely suggests that the chips have passed.
                However, if the modulation appears too quickly with a sudden peak, it suggests that one of the
                chips in the channel is faulty.
            </li>
        </ul>
        Below, we outline some of the common failure modes during cold screening.
        <ul>
            <li>During the SSA scan, no modulation is observed.
                <ul>
                    <li>First, check to make sure all the cables are properly connected to the correct channels.
                        The fiber optic cable also frequently comes loose.</li>
                    <li>
                        It has been observed that decreasing the current on the current sources and
                        turning it back on allows the modulation to reappear. It is currently
                        unknown why this fixes the issue.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Probe the connection between the tower sockets and the Samtech connectors. If either
                        the SAFB connection or SAOUT connection is open, that suggests the cable is torn.
                        Visually inspect the cabling for breaks. Be sure to keep the probe current below 1mA
                        to avoid blowing the amplifier. If there are breaks, the only current solution
                        is to solder over the break with copper wire. Unfortunately, this fix is only
                        temporary as the solder will not likely hold for very long.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        It is possible that the squids in the SSA box are faulty. To test this, swap the SSA
                        chips within the squid box after taking the tower out of the dewar, and retest the
                        same channels. If modulation returns, the fault is in the SSA chips.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        It is possible that the Low Noise Amplifier (LNA) in the tower for the channel has been blown,
                        in which the only
                        recourse is to replace the LNA.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        This symptom also occurs when the squids are no longer superconducting. Thump the dewar
                        to check that there is enough helium.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                During the scan for \(I_{C,col}\), there is no modulation.
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        This situation is similar to no modulation during the SSA scan, but the potential problem areas
                        are now the SQ1Bias and FB1 connections. Check that these cables are connected to the
                        correct channels and check for opens.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        There is a small chance that the \(I_{C,col}\) is simply too large, so it is out of range of
                        the scan. To verify this, simply start scanning the Row Selects. If modulation is observed,
                        then there is no issue.
                    </li>
                    <li> If the channel is not screenable, the chips need to be rescreened.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                During the scan for \(I_{C,col}\), the modulation appears too quickly.
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        If the modulation appears early but then decreases again, this suggests that there is cross-talk
                        on one of the chips. All three chips on the channel will need to be rescreened to pin down
                        which chip is the culprit.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If the modulation appear immediately or does not follow a sine wave pattern, this suggests a
                        cross-short that was not caught during room temperature screening.
                        If the row selects can still scan, it is useful to do so for future reference even though
                        the chips cannot pass this screening. Typically, however, this usually renders the entire
                        channel unscreenable. Regardless, the chips need to be rescreened
                    </li>

                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                While scanning the row selects, there are abnormal values for modulation or the critical currents.
                <ul>
                    <li>The most sure-fire way to determine the problem is to observe the waveform on the oscilloscope.
                        The expected pattern is for a sine wave to appear, reach some maximum modulation, then slowly
                        shrink.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Common abnormal waveforms include a wave with multiple peaks, a wave that does not complete
                        full modulation, a noisy waveform, or no modulation at all.
                    </li>
                    <li>If there is no modulation at all, or if the modulation is very low, that suggests that
                        the row select was not turned on. In this case, the \(I_{C,min}\) sometimes
                        matches the \(I_{C,col}\). If this same issue occurs in the RS of every channel, that suggests
                        there is an open: either a wirebond came off or the connector was not fastened properly.
                        This can be easily verified with the multimeter and breakout box. In this case, the chips
                        need to be rescreened.
                    </li>
                    <li>If there is a double peak, this usually means there is some damage to the squids in that row.
                        If the modulation and \(I_{C,max}\) aren't too different from the other rows, and if the
                        waveform at the max modulation is still a single peak sine wave, then the chip may still
                        be acceptable. Otherwise, the chip has failed screening.
                    </li>

                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        During this scan, mark each chip as either passed, failed, or unknown (and need to be rescreened). Specifying
        the
        exact failure mode will help in determining the best rescreen pattern. Currently, all the results are
        recorded in the spreadsheet <a

        <h3>Packaging and Delivery</h3>
        Once the screening results are obtained, each chip is sorted into passed, failed (includes both chips that
        were bypassed during room temperature screening and failed cold screening), or need to be rescreened.
        <h4>Dismounting Chips</h4>
        A tweezer is used to pull off the wirebonds. Two wooden sticks are used to twist the squid chips from the
        side, which twists off the rubber cement used to glue the chip. The chip is then placed into a gel pack
        labeled passed, failed, or rescreen. Repeat until all the chips are sorted.
        <h4>Final Verfication and Delivery</h4>
        Each chip in the passed gelpack is observed under a microscope to verify its ID, which is used to
        cross-reference the screening data. Once verification is complete, the gel pack is packaged and shipped.
        For a detailed account on how to package a gel pack of squid chips, see here: <a href="package.html">Squid
            Packaging</a>.

        The cold Screening data is compiled into a zip file with the code on Kent Irwin's computer. It provides
        the Ic min, max and modulation for each of the passed chips, as well as information about Ic,col.

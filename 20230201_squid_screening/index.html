        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            Superconducting Quantum Interference Devices, or SQuIDs, have been used in detector modules for many years.
            As the detector density has increased with newer receivers, so has the required number of SQuID chips.
            The newest BICEP receivers, BA2 and BA4, each have 12 detector modules requiring 64 squid chips each, for a
            total of 768 chips.
        </p>
        <p>
            Unfortunately, squid chips are frequently faulty, and a single failed chip will often affect the performance
            of
            nearby chips in a module. Thus, it is necessary to pre-screen the squid chips before integrating them into
            the detector modules. This screening was historically performed by Prof. Kent Irwin's lab before the task
            was transfered to Prof. Chao-Lin Kuo's lab in the summer of 2022.
        </p>
        <p>
            Below, we summarize the procedure and statistics of the squid screening since it was taken up by the Kuo
            lab.
        </p>
        <h3>The SQuID Chip, Screening PCB, and Screening Tower</h3>
        <p>
            The squid chip is quite small and fragile, measuring 6.6 mm by 3.0 mm by 0.18 mm. While handling, great care
            must be taken
            to only handle the sides of the chip, as touching the top can damage the sensitive electronics. The squids
            are
            delivered
            by NIST in gel packs, which serve as their ideal storage system due to the electrical insulation and
            physical
            stability.
        </p>
        <p>
            The chip serves as an amplifier at its superconducting temperatures below 10K, but it is typically
            tested and used at temperatures below 4K. As a time domain multiplexor, the squid reads in 11 inputs (IN)
            that are
            all output on a single output line (OUT). The row selects (RS) are applied to select a single input at a
            time
            for a specific amount of time. By correlating the signal to the corresponding row select, it is possible to
            read
            out 11 different inputs with a single squid chip.
        </p>
        <p>
            The feedback line (FB) serves to bias the input to maximize the sensitivity, but during screening, the FB
            acts as the varying input to verify the ideal bias current that should run through OUT.
        </p>

        <p>
            The screening PCB has 24 slots for squid chips and 10 connectors, each of which has 8 signal/ground pairs.
            The row selects make up the majority of the connectors, with 5 connectors responsible for the 33 row
            selects. With 3 rows labeled X, Y, and Z, each row select activates the response of up to 8 squid chips.
        </p>
        <p>
            The INPUT, FB1, and MUXOUT are connected to the sides of the chip slot area, while
            SAOUT and SAFB are connected to the pin area where the Squid Series Array box is attached during screening.
            These connectors all have 8 signal/ground pairs for the 8 channels labeled 0 through 7.

        <h2>Procedure</h2>

        <h3>Squid Chip Preparation and Mounting</h3>
        At this stage, the goal is the mount the desired number of Squid chips onto the screening board. The screening
        PCB contains 24 slots for Squid chips,
        but not all 24 slots need to be used. The chips need to be glued, wirebonded, and have their positions recorded.
        <h4>General notes</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Always grab the chips with tweezers by the edges of the chip; try to avoid touching the flat top of the
                chip whenever possible</li>
            <li>Wear electrostatic discharge (ESD) protection whenever possible</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Gluing: 30 - 60 min per board</h4>
        Below is a summary of the procedure for gluing chips onto a PCB. For a more detailed Standard Operating
        Procedure, see here:
        <a href="gluing.html">Gluing Procedure</a>

        <ul>
            <li>Clean the PCB bond pads with the white eraser, pink eraser, and isopropyl alcohol in the respective
                order. The bond pads should be shiny by the end of the cleaning</li>
            <li>Set up 3 aluminum trays, 1 for isopropyl alcohol (IPA), and 2 for acetone. Squirt the liquids into their
                respective tins up to a depth of approximately 5 mm, enough to submerge the Squid chips.</li>
            <li>Using a vacuum try handling system, carefully remove a chip from its gel pack with tweezers.</li>
            <li>While holding the chip with tweezers, gently shake the chip in the acetone tray for 10 seconds or until
                the photoresist has been completely removed.
                Repeat the chip shaking in the other acetone tray, then in the IPA tray. If the chip already has its
                photoresist removed, the first aceton tray is optional.</li>
            <li>Holding the chip on the Kimwipe, blow dry nitrogen from a Compressed Nitrogen Gun until chip is dry.
            </li>
            <li>Using a small wooden rod, lightly dab the bottle of rubber cement to cover the tip of the rod. </li>
            <li>Apply the glue from the wooden rod onto a Squid chip slot on the PCB, then place the Squid chip on top
                of the glue, ensuring correct orientation.
                Use two wooden rods to press the Squids onto the board, making sure to only touch the corners of the
                chip. </li>
            <li>Repeat the process until the board is full of Squid chips. Use a microscope to verify the IDs of the
                chips,
                and record them in a table while double checking for the correct orientation.</li>
        </ul>

        </figure>
        <h4>Wirebonding: 2 - 4 hr per board</h4>
        Below is a summary of how to wirebond each group of pads. For a more detailed explanation, see here:
        <a href="wirebond.html">Wirebonding Procedure</a>
        <ul>
            <li>Mount the PCB onto the wirebonding block</li>
            <li>Wirebond the row selects, making sure to start at the copper PCB pads and end on the NbTi pads of the
                Squids.
                There are a total of 11 row selects per chip, with an input and output, for a total of 22 wirebonds per
                chip.
                A full board has a max of 24 chips, for a maximum of 528 bonds.
            </li>
            <li>Wirebond the inputs in a stitch pattern on the Squid chip, ensuring the input coils are all connected in
                series.
                Ensure that the bonds are in the middle of the pad so that the bond surface does not touch two different
                pads.
                Keeping the bonds short and triangular shaped will also decrease the probability of cross-shorts.
                Then, wirebond the first and last input on the chip to the PCB.
                There are a total of 11 inputs, requiring 10 wirebonds to connect them in series.
                Adding the two wirebonds for connecting the inputs to the PCB, this is a total of 12 wirebonds per chip.
                This is a total of 288 max bonds per board.
            </li>
            <li>Wirebond the feedback and output pads. These bonds on the sides of the chips are mostly straightforward
                except for the bonds
                on the outside of row X. These bonds are in a pentagonal shape with crossing wires, increasing the
                chance of contact shorts.
                Great care must be taken to ensure ideal bond lengths. There are a total of 8 bonds per chip, for a
                maximum of 192 bonds per board.
            </li>
            <li>
                Once all the wirebonds are complete, either store the board in a nitrogen cabinet or move directly to
                room temperature screening.
                A single board has a maximum of 1008 bonds, from 42 bonds per chip.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Room Temperature Screening: 20 - 120 min per board</h3>
        This step is crucial for increasing the yield of the overall screening process. Without checking for opens and
        cross-shorts at room temperature,
        these issues can cause an entire row or column of chips to fail cold screening. Here, we identify the chips that
        read abnormal resistances,
        then wirebond over the chip to bypass the chip entirely.
        <h4>Identifying Faulty Chips</h4>
        Below is a summary of the procedure for identifying faulty chips. For a detailed account, see here: <a
            href="roomtemp.html">Room Temperature Screening Procedure</a>
        <ul>
            <li>Connect the screening PCB to the screening tower.</li>
            <li>Record the resistance of the Input, Row Selects, and Feedback lines using a multimeter and the breakout
                box.</li>
            <li>With the PCB still attached, probe the pairs of pins with just a multimeter to record the resistance of
                the Out lines.</li>
            <li>Detach the PCB from the tower, and record the resistance of the Out lines.</li>
            <li>Using the multimeter, probe the connectors directly to determine the resistance of Input, Row Select,
                and Feedback lines</li>
            <li>Identify any resistance reading that is more than 10% off from the other readings of the same type,
                or when a difference in resistance is caused by connecting the PCB to the tower.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The purpose of recording two sets of resistances is to see if any abnormal resistance readings are a result
            of
            cross-shorts. When the PCB is connected to the tower, every connector is connected to a common ground. Thus,
            any
            cross-short would allow a current to flow through an additional path to the common ground, causing a change
            in
            resistance. The most common identified errors are cross-shorts, opens, and single point abnormal
            resistances.
            We will explore how to identify the exact chip in each of these cases.</p>

        <b>Cross-short:</b>
        <ul>
            <li>
                The cross-short means that within a specific chip, electrical lines are shorted where they shouldn't be.
                This leads to a smaller resistance reading for any measurement involving the short.
            </li>
            <li>
                For example, if a chip has the RS 4 shorted to the Feedback line, then while the tower is connected
                to the PCB, this will result in a smaller resistance reading for both the feedback in that channel
                and for the entire row select. When the tower is not connected, the resistances will read normally,
                because the cross-short will not allow current to flow through the disconnected ground.
            </li>
            <li>
                To verify the chip that is causing the lowered resistance readings, while the PCB is disconnected
                from the tower, measure the resistance between the RS 4 connector and the feedback row that
                contains the chip. If this resistance is not open, that indicates a cross-short.
            </li>
            <li> When the cross-short occurs between a row select and a channel reading like FB, OUT, or INPUT, then
                it is easy to find the faulty chip by finding the row and column where a short exists.
            </li>
            <li>When the cross-short occurs between two row readings or two column readings, then identification
                becomes trickier. The most certain method is to debond and bypass a chip, then remeasure the
                resistances. If the resistance readings become normal, then that was the faulty chip. Otherwise,
                rebond and debond a different chip until the problem chip is found. There are other tricks for
                identifying the problem chip more quickly like calculating the position through expected
                resistance readings, but those methods require more intuition and experience and have a
                higher chance of damaging the chip.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <b>Opens:</b>
        <ul>
            <li>Opens are identified by measuring an unexpected open across the disconnected PCB. An open on a row
                select
                could be any one of 8 chips in the row, while an open across a column has only 3 potential suspects.
            </li>
            <li>
                Opens can always be caused by a faulty wirebond. Before performing additional wirebonds to short across
                suspected opens, it may save time to perform pull tests on the wirebonds in the problem row/column.
            </li>
            <li>When there's an open across the Feedback or Out, start shorting across chips starting from row Z. By
                wirebonding
                the two Feedback/Out pads on row Y, the chip on row Z becomes bypassed. Measure the resistance. Repeat
                until
                the multimeter no longer reads open, and the last bypassed chip is the cause of the open. Bonding on the
                PCB pads
                decreases the possibility of damage on the chips themselves.

            </li>
            <li>
                If there's an open across the Input, choose a chip in the column, then perform a long wirebond from one
                end of the
                input to the other. Measure to check if the Input row is still open. Repeat until the open Input chip is
                identified.
            </li>
            <li>If there's an open across a RS, choose a chip in the row, then wirebond the two adjacent RS pads to
                short the RS
                of that chip. Measure the RS to check for the open. Repeat until the open RS chip is identified.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <b>Singular abnormal readings</b>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Very occassionally, a single resistance reading will be significantly higher or lower than expected, but
                without affecting the resistance readings of any other lines.
            </li>
            <li>
                In this case, the procedure is similar to that of identifying faulty chip causing an open: short across
                each chip in the row/column and observe the change in resistance. For row selects, shorting across
                a single chip should decrease the resistance reading by about 1.0kOhm +- 0.1 kOhm. The full list of
                expected resistance per chip will be in the next section.
            </li>
            <li>
                If the change in resistance is much higher or lower than expected, that indicates that the chip contains
                a singular abnormal reading, and needs to be bypassed.
            </li>
        </ul>
        Once the problem chips are identified, the temporary shorting bonds are removed, and the problem chip is
        bypassed.

        <h4>Bypassing Chips</h4>

        <ul>
            <li>To bypass a squid chip, we remove the wirebonds attached the chip and replace them with shorting bonds
                on the PCB bond pads. The squid chip may be removed to ease the shorting process.
            </li>
            <li>
                The row selects are the easiest to short across. The RS+ bond and the RS- bond are next to each other,
                so to make the shorting bond, simply bond the two adjacent RS pads on the PCB.
            </li>
            <li>
                The input shorting bond requires bonding across the entire chip. The Out and Feedback lines
                have similar shorting bonds, except two bonds are required because the signal and ground
                both come from the left side.
            </li>
            <li>
                When the chip to bypass is in column Z, it provides an easier shorting bond. Here, it is only necessary
                to bond the adjacent Out and Feedback pads to the left of the Z chip. If both Y and Z need to be
                bypassed,
                then it is only necessary to bond the adjacent pads to the left of the Y chip, as shown in the figure
                below.
                If all three chips are to be bypassed, then none of the shorting bonds are required besides the
                RS shorting bonds, as that column will not be screened during cold screening anyway.
            </li>
        </ul>
        The Figure below has diagrams for the different types of shorting bonds. Every type of shorting bond bypasses
        a single chip except for the shorting bond on the Feedback and Out diagram. When that type of shorting bond is
        placed, every chip to the right is bypassed. In the diagram, both chip Y and Z are bypassed with just two
        wirebonds. The diagram shows Chip X, the left side of Chip Y, and the right side of Chip Z for column 0 only.

        After the bypassing is complete, an additional resistance check should be performed to verify there are no more
        abnormalities. Due to the bypassing, some of the resistance readings will be lower. The table below specifies
        the approximate expected resistance for each non-bypassed chip. Note that the specific numbers will vary by chip
        wafer, with a deviation up to 10-20%.

        <h3>Cryogenic Testing</h3>
        After a screening board has been prepared with chips free of abnormal resistance readings, it is now ready for
        cryogenic screening. The purpose of this stage
        is to ensure each chip can serve its purpose in the detector module as a proper superconducting amplifier. Due
        to the fragile nature of the chips, they may not function
        perfectly despite normal room temperature resistances.

        <h4>Managing Helium</h4>
        To ensure the squid chips are superconducting, they must be dipped into liquid helium, which has a boiling point
        of 4K. Because helium has such a low boiling point, it is necessary to keep it in a well insulated dewawr;
        however,
        the opening must be large enough to fit the screening PCB and the screening tower. Helium in their storage
        dewars
        must be transfered into the specially designed Blue Dewar for screening to procede. For a detailed account on
        how
        to transfer helium, see here: <a href="transfer.html">Helium Transfer</a>

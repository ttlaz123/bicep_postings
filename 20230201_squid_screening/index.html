        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            Superconducting Quantum Interference Devices, or SQuIDs, have been used in detector modules for many years.
            As the detector density has increased with newer receivers, so has the required number of SQuID chips.
            The newest BICEP receivers, BA2 and BA4, each have 12 detector modules requiring 64 squid chips each, for a
            total of 768 chips.
        </p>
        <p>
            Unfortunately, squid chips are frequently faulty, and a single failed chip will often affect the performance
            of
            nearby chips in a module. Thus, it is necessary to pre-screen the squid chips before integrating them into
            the detector modules. This screening was historically performed by Prof. Kent Irwin's lab before the task
            was transfered to Prof. Chao-Lin Kuo's lab in the summer of 2022.
        </p>
        <p>
            Below, we summarize the procedure and statistics of the squid screening since it was taken up by the Kuo
            lab.
        </p>
        <h3>Common Terminology</h3>
        For a more comprehensive glossary, see <a href="glossary.html">here</a>. 
        <ul>
            <li><b>SQuID</b>: Superconducting Quantum Interference Device measures small magnetic fields. 
                Wikipedia article: <a href="articles/squid_wiki.pdf">SQuID</a></li>
            <li><b>Squid chip</b>: The Mux 15b SQuID chip produced by NIST acts as an amplifier for the detector modules. 
                Measuring 3.0 mm by 6.6 mm, these small chips require an initial round of screening before they can be installed. 
                In the chip, there are RS squids, which receive flux from the row selects, and SQ1 squids, which receive 
                flux from Input and Feedback. </li>
            <li><b>Screening PCB</b>: The DrEleven PCB holds up to 24 chips with 3 columns marked X, Y, Z and 8 rows from 0 through 7.
                The Squid chip must first be wirebonded to the screening PCB before any screening can take place. </li>
            <li><b>Dip Probe</b>: Also called the <b>Screening Tower</b>, it houses all the electronics for both 
                sending the Squid chip inputs and receiving outputs from the chips. The Screening PCB must first be 
                connected to the dip probe before in order to be dipped into liquid helium for cryogenic screening.
            </li>
            <li><b>Input (IN)</b>: The input coils receive signal from the detectors during operation and produce flux through the SQ1 squids. 
                However, during the screening process,
                they are simply checked for connectivity and cross-shorts. The 22 input pads (which connects to the 11 input coils),
                are on the bottom side of the squid chip. 
            </li>
            <li><b>Row Select (RS)</b>: The row selects pass flux through ths RS squids, which turn on and off, or "select", a specific input 
                to be read out. The 22 row select pads are
                on the top side of the squid chip.
            </li>
            <li><b>Output (OUT1/2, SQ1OUT)</b>: The output line is connected to the SQ1BIAS line. Current is passed in, and the output of the 
                current is read as the response of the squid chip. During normal operation, the output is set to a particular 
                value, but during screening, the output sweeps through multiple current values to check its response.
                The pads are on the top half of the sides of the chip. 
            </li>
            <li><b>Feedback (FB1/2, SQ1FB)</b>: The feedback line passes in a current that produces flux through the squids. This flux 
                affects to response of the SQ1 squid. During normal operation, the FB follows the 
                input to ensure maximum senstivity, but during Squid Screening, the FB sweeps through 
                different currents to visualize the characteristic squid sine wave.

        <h2>Procedure: 6 - 11 hours per board </h2>

        <h3>Squid Chip Preparation and Mounting: 2.5 - 5 hours per board</h3>
        At this stage, the goal is the mount the desired number of Squid chips onto the screening board. The screening
        PCB contains 24 slots for Squid chips,
        but not all 24 slots need to be used. The chips need to be glued, wirebonded, and have their positions recorded. 
        Below is a summary of the important steps.
        For a detailed procedure, see here: <a href="mounting.html">Mounting Squid Chips to the Screening PCB</a>
        

        <h4>Gluing: 30 - 60 min per board</h4>
        <p>First clean the screening PCB, clean the chips, then using rubber cement, glue the squid chips onto the PCB.
            Cleaning takes 5-10 minutes, while each chip takes 1-2 minutes to glue, for a total of 30-60 minutes per
            PCB.
        </p>
        <h4>Wirebonding: 2 - 4 hr per board</h4>
        <p>
            For each row of 8 chips, the wirebonding connects all the row selects in series.
            For each column of 3 chips,
            the wirebonding connects the Feedbacks, Inputs, and Outputs in series. Each chip requires 42 wirebonds for
            its
            52 pads. Each chip takes between 5-30 minutes to wirebond, depending on wirebonder setting, wire
            cooperation,
            and general experience.
            This accounts for a total of 2-12 hours per board, but an experienced wirebonder can usually finish a board
            within 4 hours.
        </p>

                correspond to each other.

                        return filename
                    });

                );

        <h3>Room Temperature Screening: 20 - 120 min per board</h3>
        <p>
            This step was added to the procedure in 2022 August, after it was noticed that there was a significant correlation between 
            abnormal room temperature resistance readings and failed chip screenings.
            After implementing the room temperature screening, it was discovered that this step is 
            crucial for increasing the yield of the overall screening process. Without checking for opens
            and
            cross-shorts at room temperature,
            these issues can cause an entire row or column of chips to fail cold screening. 
            
           
        </p>
        <p>
            In the warm screening stage, we identify the chips that
            read abnormal resistances,
            then wirebond over the chip to bypass the chip entirely.
            Below is a summary of the procedure for identifying faulty chips. For a detailed account, see here: <a
                href="roomtemp.html">Room Temperature Screening Procedure</a>

        </p>
        <p>
            We use a multimeter to directly measure the
            resistance of the squid chips at room temperature.
            Because the squids are connected in series,
            the expected readout of the Row Select, Input, Feedback, and Output are some multiple of the
            resistances of each individual chip. The resistance measurement is also different depending on
            whether or not the screening tower is connected because of a series resistance.
        </p>
        <p>
            The table below shows the expected readings, and the
            pager has an example of recorded resistances. If the actual readings do not match the
            expected, then that means some chips either have cross-shorts, opens, or abnormal resistance readings.

        By probing different combination of connectors, or shorting certain chips one by one, we can 
            identify the individual chip that is causing the abnormal resistance readings. Once the 
            chip is identified, we wirebond over the chip with shorting bonds to bypass the chip.

                    In the comparison of the circuit diagram to the realistic schematic, the red and green pads/lines
                    correspond to each other. Columns 4 and 5 are empty (e), so there is nothing recorded there, and
                    the row selects are about 2.2 kOhms lower than if the PCB were fully populated.
                    Row select 17 was initially open, but now reads the expected resistance after correction. Also
                    notice
                    that when the PCB is disconnected from the screening tower, the FB reading is about 5kOhms lower.
                    This is because there is a 5 kOhms series resistance from the PCB to the tower.
                </p>

                    In the probing diagrams, the blue represents traces above the PCB, while the red represents
                    traces below the PCB. Row select probing measures the resistance of 8 chips in series, while
                    the other probing measures the resistance of 3 chips in series.

                <p>
                    On the bottom column of the PCB, the chip on the left and the chip in the middle 
                    are bypassed. It is evident by the long wirebond that arcs over the entire chip.

        <h3>Cryogenic Testing: 3 - 4 hours per board</h3>
        Below is a summary of cryogenic testing. For a detailed procedure, see:
        <a href="cryotest.html">Cryogenic Screening Procedure</a>.
        <p>

        Most issues with a squid chip can be identified by an abnormal reading for one of these four values:
    </p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>\(I_{C,col}\)</b>: this demonstrates how robust the RS switches are across an entire chip. If the \(I_{C,col}\) is too low, 
                        that generally means the RS squids are turning on when they should not be, allowing some unintended  
                        inputs to be read out.
            </li>
            <li><b>Modulation</b>: at each bias current running through SQ1OUT, we sweep through the Feedback current 
                with a ramp function at 8 KHz. Each value of feedback current produces a particular OUT response,
                with the overall response shape being a sine wave. The amplitude of this sine wave is the modulation

            </li>
            <li> <b>\(I_{C,min}\)</b>: this value is specific to each row select and indicates the minimum device current at which 
                a row sees some modulation. The values should be relatively constant across an entire squid chip 
                to allow for easier squid tuning.
            </li>
            <li><b>\(I_{C,max}\)</b>: this value is specific to each row select and indicates the device current at which 
                the modulation for the row is at its maximum. This is the current that the squid should be biased at during 
            squid tuning to maximize the amplification of the signal.</li>

            We plunge the screening tower with a populated screening PCB into helium to test the performance
            of the squid chips at 4K, which is within its superconducting range. After connecting the
            tower to the screening electronics and running the screening software, we identify the
            \(I_{C,col}\) for each column of chips and the \(I_{C,min}\), \(I_{C,max}\), and modulation of each row
            select. An example of expected readings is shown below.

                    When measuring Ic col, the curve should start out flat and slowly curve up. The Ic col
                    is the influction point: where the modulation just starts to increase. The Ic min is
                    measured similarly to the Ic col, except a row select is turned on, so the modulation
                    begins much earlier. The Ic max is measured as the maximum modulation for a specific
                    row select. The Ic col should be significantly higher than the Ic max.

        If any of these 4 values do not read as expected, it suggests that there are issues with the SQuIDs in the 
        squid chip. For example, if a RS squid allows in less than its nominal current, it can lower the \(I_{C,col}\).
        If an Input squid's flux quanta is slightly different from its neighboring squids, then it can cause 
        destructive interference and lower the modulation of the row select. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Some of these issues are specific to an 
        individual chip, in which case that chip is marked as defective. However, some issues like a lowered \(I_{C,col}\)
        or an open row select can impact the reading on an entire column or row. In these cases, it is 
        not possible to determine which chip is the faulty one through one screening alone, and the chip is marked Unknown. In many cases, this 
        means even though 2 out of 3 chips are good chips, the one bad chip makes all 3 fail the screening. In the worst 
        case, one bad chip can cause 8 chips to fail the screening. 
    </p>
    <p>A more comprehensive list of failure modes are discussed in the <a href="cryotest.html">Cryogenic Screening Procedure</a>, 
        while the statistics for these failures are discussed below.</p>


        <h3>Packaging and Delivery</h3>
        Once the screening results are obtained, each chip is sorted into passed, failed (includes both chips that
        were bypassed during room temperature screening and failed cold screening), or need to be rescreened.
        <p>
        A tweezer is used to pull off the wirebonds. Two wooden sticks are used to twist the squid chips from the
        side, which twists off the rubber cement used to glue the chip. The chip is then placed into a gel pack
        labeled passed, failed, or rescreen. Repeat until all the chips are sorted.
    </p>
    <p>
        Each chip in the passed gelpack is observed under a microscope to verify its ID, which is used to
        cross-reference the screening data. Once verification is complete, the gel pack is packaged and shipped.
    </p>
<p>
        The cold Screening data is compiled into a zip file with the code on Kent Irwin's computer. It provides
        the Ic min, max and modulation for each of the passed chips, as well as information about Ic,col.

        <h2>Statistics</h2>
        <p>
        The pass, fail, and unknown rates of the squid chips are analyzed from 2019 to 2022. Before 2019, the screening process 
        was still manual, meaning the bias current was manually adjusted, and the 4 impotant quantities were
        manually calculated. Carl Dawson was the first to develop and conduct the automated screening procedure in 2019 April.
        From 2019 April to 2021 February, Carl screened approximately 420 chips, passing around 310. 
    </p>
        <p>In 2021 May, Nicholas Rapidas screened his first batch of squid chips, and he was enventually joined by 
            Jason Corbin. They screened approximately 700 chips (620 unique) between 2021 May and 2022 April, passing around 300.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Kuo lab started their squid screening training in 2022 May, and from May to August, we screened 
            approximately 820 chips, although many of the chips were rescreened, for a total of 600 unique chips. Out 
            of these, approximately 340 passed. 

        </p>
        <p>
            We plot the statistics below. For a more detailed set of statistics, see <a href="stats.html">Statistics</a>
        </p>
        <h3>Room Temperature</h3>
        <p>
        Room temperature screening did not begin until 2022 August, so it is difficult to provide detailed statistics. A total of 
        82 chips have been bypassed since 2022 August, when room temperature screening became a part of the procedure.
        However, from 2021 May to 2022 July, the unknown rates of the screening results have ranged from 30% to as high 
        as 60%. After warm screening, the unknown rate dropped to less than 20%.
    </p><p>
        Note that unknown is calculated after the fact by checking for whether the chip was rescreened. If the chip was appears in a 
        later screening batch, it is marked unknown for the current batch. Thus, wafers 31 and 37 unknown rates are lower because 
        they have not been rescreened.

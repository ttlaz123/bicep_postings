    <ul>
        <li><b>SQuID</b>: Superconducting Quantum Interference Device measures small magnetic fields.
            Wikipedia article: <a href="articles/squid_wiki.pdf">SQuID</a></li>
        <li><b>Squid chip</b>: The Mux 15b SQuID chip produced by NIST acts as an amplifier for the detector
            modules.
            Measuring 3.0 mm by 6.6 mm, these small chips require an initial round of screening before they can be
            installed.
            In the chip, there are RS squids, which receive flux from the row selects, and SQ1 squids, which receive
            flux from Input and Feedback. </li>
        <li><b>Screening PCB</b>: The DrEleven PCB holds up to 24 chips with 3 columns marked X, Y, Z and 8 rows
            from 0 through 7.
            The Squid chip must first be wirebonded to the screening PCB before any screening can take place. </li>
        <li><b>Dip Probe</b>: Also called the <b>Screening Tower</b>, it houses all the electronics for both
            sending the Squid chip inputs and receiving outputs from the chips. The Screening PCB must first be
            connected to the dip probe before in order to be dipped into liquid helium for cryogenic screening.
        </li>
        <li><b>Input (IN)</b>: The input coils receive signal from the detectors during operation and produce flux
            through the SQ1 squids.
            However, during the screening process,
            they are simply checked for connectivity and cross-shorts. The 22 input pads (which connects to the 11
            input coils),
            are on the bottom side of the squid chip.
        </li>
        <li><b>Row Select (RS)</b>: The row selects pass flux through ths RS squids, which turn on and off, or
            "select", a specific input
            to be read out. The 22 row select pads are
            on the top side of the squid chip.
        </li>
        <li><b>Output (OUT1/2, SQ1OUT)</b>: The output line is connected to the SQ1BIAS line. Current is passed in,
            and the output of the
            current is read as the response of the squid chip. During normal operation, the output is set to a
            particular
            value, but during screening, the output sweeps through multiple current values to check its response.
            The pads are on the top half of the sides of the chip.
        </li>
        <li><b>Feedback (FB1/2, SQ1FB)</b>: The feedback line passes in a current that produces flux through the
            squids. This flux
            affects to response of the SQ1 squid. During normal operation, the FB follows the
            input to ensure maximum senstivity, but during Squid Screening, the FB sweeps through
            different currents to visualize the characteristic squid sine wave.

            <b>Modulation</b> is specific to each Row select, and it indicates how much an input signal on that row can be
            amplified. The larger the modulation, the easier it is to see a small signal.
        </li>
        <li><b> \(I_{C,max}\):</b>For each row select,
            there is a particular device current, \(I_{C,max}\), at which the modulation is at its largest.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b> \(I_{C,col}\)</b> is screened across an entire column of 3 chips, and it indicates the maximum device
            current
            that
            can be applied before current starts flowing through the Input squids, at which point the row is turned
            on.
            Time domain multiplexing requires specific rows to turn on only when current is applied to the specific
            row
            select, thus it is desirable for
            \(I_{C,col}\) to be significantly higher than any \(I_{C,max}\) in the chips on the column. If
            \(I_{C,col}\)
            were lower than the \(I_{C,max}\) in any row, then it is no longer possible to achieve maximum
            modulation
            for the squid chip without certainty which row the signal is arriving from.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>  \(I_{C,min}\)</b> specifies the minimum current at which a specific row sees some modulation. To ensure that
            a particular row only turns on when chosen by the Row Select, it is desireable for \(I_{C,min}\) to
            be significantly above 0, but a small fraction of \(I_{C,max}\) (typically around a fifth to a tenth)
            so there is room to adjust the bias current.

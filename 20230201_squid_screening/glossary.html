    <ul>
        <li><b>SQuID</b>: Superconducting Quantum Interference Device measures small magnetic fields.
            Wikipedia article: <a href="articles/squid_wiki.pdf">SQuID</a></li>
        <li><b>Squid chip</b>: The Mux 15b SQuID chip produced by NIST acts as an amplifier for the detector
            modules.
            Measuring 3.0 mm by 6.6 mm, these small chips require an initial round of screening before they can be
            installed.
            In the chip, there are RS squids, which receive flux from the row selects, and SQ1 squids, which receive
            flux from Input and Feedback. </li>
        <li><b>Screening PCB</b>: The DrEleven PCB holds up to 24 chips with 3 columns marked X, Y, Z and 8 rows
            from 0 through 7.
            The Squid chip must first be wirebonded to the screening PCB before any screening can take place. </li>
        <li><b>Dip Probe</b>: Also called the <b>Screening Tower</b>, it houses all the electronics for both
            sending the Squid chip inputs and receiving outputs from the chips. The Screening PCB must first be
            connected to the dip probe before in order to be dipped into liquid helium for cryogenic screening.
        </li>
        <li><b>Input (IN)</b>: The input coils receive signal from the detectors during operation and produce flux
            through the SQ1 squids.
            However, during the screening process,
            they are simply checked for connectivity and cross-shorts. The 22 input pads (which connects to the 11
            input coils),
            are on the bottom side of the squid chip.
        </li>
        <li><b>Row Select (RS)</b>: The row selects pass flux through ths RS squids, which turn on and off, or
            "select", a specific input
            to be read out. The 22 row select pads are
            on the top side of the squid chip.
        </li>
        <li><b>Output (OUT1/2, SQ1OUT)</b>: The output line is connected to the SQ1BIAS line. Current is passed in,
            and the output of the
            current is read as the response of the squid chip. During normal operation, the output is set to a
            particular
            value determined by Squid tuning, but during screening, the output sweeps through multiple current values to check its response.
            The pads are on the top half of the sides of the chip.
        </li>
        <li><b>Feedback (FB1/2, SQ1FB)</b>: The feedback line passes in a current that produces flux through the
            squids. This flux
            affects to response of the SQ1 squid. During normal operation, the FB follows the
            input to ensure maximum senstivity, but during Squid Screening, the FB sweeps through
            different currents to visualize the characteristic squid sine wave.

        </li>
       <li>
            <b>Series Array Feedback (SAFB)</b>: The feedback line that passes through the Squid Box 
            instead of the Squid chips. The feedback serves to to set the response of the SQuID array in the 
            box to further amplify the signal from the chips. 
       </li>
       <li>
        <b>Series Array Output (SAOUT)</b>: The bias current that passes through the Squid Box and reads out 
        out the amplified signal from the Squid Chips. 
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Row Select Squids</b>: These are the squids that sit on the SQ1OUT line and read the flux given 
            by the row selects. When no current is passing through the row select coils, the RS Squid is "off"
            and allows current through up to a certain critical current. When current passes through the row select 
            coils, flux is passed through the RS squid, which reduces the current allowed through and turns it "on", 
            which forces current from SQ1OUT into the \(R_{series}\) resistor and the input squids.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Input Squids</b>:
            The input squids receive flux from both the feedback and input coils. By setting the feedback current to 
            specific values, the input squid can be set to the appropriate response to maximize the amplification 
            of any signal from the input coils.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Modulation</b> is specific to each Row select, and it indicates how much an input signal on that row can be
            amplified. The larger the modulation, the easier it is to see a small signal.
        </li>
        <li><b> \(I_{C,max}\):</b>For each row select,
            there is a particular device current, \(I_{C,max}\), at which the modulation is at its largest.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b> \(I_{C,col}\)</b> is screened across an entire column of 3 chips, and it indicates the maximum device
            current
            that
            can be applied before current starts flowing through the Input squids, at which point the row is turned
            on.
            Time domain multiplexing requires specific rows to turn on only when current is applied to the specific
            row
            select, thus it is desirable for
            \(I_{C,col}\) to be significantly higher than any \(I_{C,max}\) in the chips on the column. If
            \(I_{C,col}\)
            were lower than the \(I_{C,max}\) in any row, then it is no longer possible to achieve maximum
            modulation
            for the squid chip without certainty which row the signal is arriving from.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>  \(I_{C,min}\)</b> specifies the minimum current at which a specific row sees some modulation. To ensure that
            a particular row only turns on when chosen by the Row Select, it is desireable for \(I_{C,min}\) to
            be significantly above 0, but a small fraction of \(I_{C,max}\) (typically around a fifth to a tenth)
            so there is room to adjust the bias current.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Squid Box</b>
            The Squid Series Array box that further amplifies the signal from SQ1OUT. This box 
            is attached to the pins of the PCB and requires its own bias current and feedback, which are 
            called SAOUT and SAFB respectively.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Blue Helium Dewar</b>
            Kent Irwin's lab has a designated blue dewar specifically designed to hold the dip probe. It 
            has a volume of approximately 40L, so it can hold approximately 2 transfers of helium 
            from a standard 100L helium storage dewar. 
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Screening Software</b>
            Designed by Carl Dawson in 2019, the automated screening system scans the critical currents and 
            modulation of the Squid chips by directly controlling the row selects and bias currents while 
            reading from the oscilloscope.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Wafer</b>
            NIST produces squid chips in batches called Wafers. The first wafer of chips scanned was W31, while 
            the last one received by Stanford in 2022 was W48. The wafer number is not sequential. As of 2023 February,
            Stanford has received Wafers 31, 37, 39, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 47, 48 from NIST, each approximately 128 chips.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Screening Batch</b>
            Each screening batch accounts for a rough 2 week period of gluing, wirebonding, and testing. Because 
            a 100L dewar of helium slowly loses helium over time, we prepare 100-200 chips at a time so they can 
            all be tested at once the moment a dewar of helium arrives. The maximum number of board dips that 
            the Kuo lab has been able to achieve for a single 100L dewar of helium has been 13 
            (eleven unique boards with 2 boards dipped twice).
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Rescreen</b>
            When a chip fails to pass screening, it is not always clear whether it was due to that particular chip 
            or caused by a neighboring chip. For example, if there is cross talk between the SQ1BIAS and 
            the feedback line, it would cause faulty readings for all three chips in the column, even if the 
            actual issue were only on one of the three chips. In these cases, the chips need to be rescreened to 
            isolate the problem chip.

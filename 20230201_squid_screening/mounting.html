    <h1>Materials</h1>
    
    <h1>Procedure</h1>
    <h4>General notes</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Always grab the chips with tweezers by the edges of the chip; try to avoid touching the flat top of the
                chip whenever possible</li>
            <li>Wear electrostatic discharge (ESD) protection whenever possible: wristbands, ESD mats</li>
        </ul>
    <h4>Gluing: 30 - 60 min per board</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Clean the PCB bond pads with the white eraser, pink eraser, and isopropyl alcohol in the respective
            order. The bond pads should be shiny by the end of the cleaning</li>
        <li>Set up 3 aluminum trays, 1 for isopropyl alcohol (IPA), and 2 for acetone. Squirt the liquids into their
            respective tins up to a depth of approximately 5 mm, enough to submerge the Squid chips.</li>
        <li>Using a vacuum try handling system, carefully remove a chip from its gel pack with tweezers.</li>
        <li>While holding the chip with tweezers, gently shake the chip in the acetone tray for 10 seconds or until
            the photoresist has been completely removed.
            Repeat the chip shaking in the other acetone tray, then in the IPA tray. If the chip already has its
            photoresist removed, the first aceton tray is optional.</li>
        <li>Holding the chip on the Kimwipe, blow dry nitrogen from a Compressed Nitrogen Gun until chip is dry.
        </li>
        <li>Using a small wooden rod, lightly dab the bottle of rubber cement to cover the tip of the rod. </li>
        <li>Apply the glue from the wooden rod onto a Squid chip slot on the PCB, then place the Squid chip on top
            of the glue, ensuring correct orientation.
            Use two wooden rods to press the Squids onto the board, making sure to only touch the corners of the
            chip. </li>
        <li>Repeat the process until the board is full of Squid chips. Use a microscope to verify the IDs of the
            chips,
            and record them in a table while double checking for the correct orientation.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Wirebonding: 2 - 12 hr per board</h4>
    <script type="text/javascript" src="scripts/pager.js"></script>

    <ul>
        <li>Mount the PCB onto the wirebonding block</li>
        <li>Wirebond the row selects, making sure to start at the copper PCB pads and end on the NbTi pads of the
            Squids.
            There are a total of 11 row selects per chip, with an input and output, for a total of 22 wirebonds per
            chip.
            A full board has a max of 24 chips, for a maximum of 528 bonds.
        </li>
        <li>Wirebond the inputs in a stitch pattern on the Squid chip, ensuring the input coils are all connected in
            series.
            Ensure that the bonds are in the middle of the pad so that the bond surface does not touch two different
            pads.
            Keeping the bonds short and triangular shaped will also decrease the probability of cross-shorts.
            Then, wirebond the first and last input on the chip to the PCB.
            There are a total of 11 inputs, requiring 10 wirebonds to connect them in series.
            Adding the two wirebonds for connecting the inputs to the PCB, this is a total of 12 wirebonds per chip.
            This is a total of 288 max bonds per board.
        </li>
        <li>Wirebond the feedback and output pads. These bonds on the sides of the chips are mostly straightforward
            except for the bonds
            on the outside of row X. These bonds are in a pentagonal shape with crossing wires, increasing the
            chance of contact shorts.
            Great care must be taken to ensure ideal bond lengths. There are a total of 8 bonds per chip, for a
            maximum of 192 bonds per board.
        </li>
        <li>
            Once all the wirebonds are complete, either store the board in a nitrogen cabinet or move directly to
            room temperature screening.
            A single board has a maximum of 1008 bonds, from 42 bonds per chip.
        </li>
    </ul>
